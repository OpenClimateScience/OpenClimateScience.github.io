Installation and Setup
----------------------

```sh
# Install dependencies using Ubuntu package manager
sudo apt install ruby-bundler ruby-dev

# It's easier to install the Ruby packages to a user directory;
#   or, a project-specific directory
LOCAL_RUBY_PATH="/home/arthur/.ruby"
mkdir -p $LOCAL_RUBY_PATH
bundle config set --local path $LOCAL_RUBY_PATH

bundle install
```

Then, to preview your work:

```sh
sh deploy.sh
```

Alternatively, run this command:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
