		<h2 class="team">Arthur Endsley, PhD</h2>
		<p>
		Arthur is a Research Scientist at the University of Montana, leading development and maintenance of the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level 4 Carbon (L4C) product. As water constraints on plant productivity are increasing under global climate change, links between carbon and water cycles are of critical interest, and he is actively using models to investigate these links. He is the Principal Investigator (PI) for the NASA-funded computational climate-science curriculum.
